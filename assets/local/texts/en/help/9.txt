Timer
%split%

    Some levels can only sustain you for a limited amount of time as indicated by the countdown in the top right corner. Remember, respawning at a checkpoint doesn't reset the timer and running out of time resets you to the beginning of the level; if you see the timer, you should probably act fast.

    Some levels have magical stopwatches and clocks that extend the amount of time you can spend in the level before having to reset.
