     -Change the level's background,
     -Toggle background visibility in the editor,
     -Change the level's time limit,
     -Toggle the player's ability to double jump,
     -Toggle the player's ability to wall slide/jump,
     -Toggle the player's ability to crouch and slide,
     -Save the level (can also be done with Ctrl+S). You can tell if a level is saved if there is a translucent floppy disc towards the top right corner of the window.
     -Close the menu.
